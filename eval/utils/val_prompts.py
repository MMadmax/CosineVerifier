Please as a grading expert, judge whether the final answers given by the candidates below are consistent with the standard answers, that is, whether the candidates answered correctly. 
Here are some evaluation criteria:
1. For mathematical answers, please first simplify and reduce the polynomial or fraction, and then proceed with the comparison.
2. Please refer to the given standard answer. You don't need to re-generate the answer to the question because the standard answer has been given. You only need to judge whether the candidate's answer is consistent with the standard answer according to the form of the question. THE STANDARD ANSWER IS ALWAYS CORRECT AND THE QUESTION IS PERFECTLY VALID. NEVER QUESTION THEM.
3. ONLY compare the FINAL ANSWER - COMPLETELY IGNORE any potential errors in the REASONING PROCESSES.
4. Some answers may be expressed in different ways, such as some answers may be a mathematical expression, some answers may be a textual description, as long as the meaning expressed is the same. Before making a judgment, please understand the question and the standard answer first, and then judge whether the candidate's answer is correct.
5. Some answers may consist of multiple items, such as multiple-choice questions, multiple-select questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, etc. Regardless of the question type, the final answer will be considered correct as long as it matches the standard answer, regardless of whether the reasoning process is correct. For multiple-select questions and multi-blank fill-in-the-blank questions, all corresponding options or blanks must be answered correctly and match the standard answer exactly to be deemed correct.
6. If the prediction is given with \\boxed{{}}, please ignore the \\boxed{{}} and only judge whether the candidate's answer is consistent with the standard answer.
7. If the candidate's answer is invalid (e.g., incomplete (cut off mid-response), lots of unnormal repetitive content, or irrelevant to the question, saying it can't answer the question because some irresistible factors, like ethical issues, no enough information, etc.), select option C (INVALID).Please judge whether the following answers are consistent with the standard answer based on the above criteria. Grade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:
A: CORRECT 
B: INCORRECT
C: INVALID
Just return the letters "A", "B", or "C", with no text around it.

Evaluation Protocol:
1. Reference Standard:
   - The standard answer is definitive and always correct
   - The question is perfectly valid - never question them
   - Do not regenerate answers; only compare with the given standard

2. Comparison Method:
   - Carefully analyze the question's requirements and the standard answer's structure
     * Determine whether the question expects exact matching of the entire standard answer or allows partial matching of its components.
     * This determination must be made based on the question's phrasing and the nature of the standard answer.
   - Compare ONLY the candidate's final answer (ignore all reasoning/explanation errors)
   - Disregard any differences in formatting or presentation style
   - For mathematical expressions: calculate step by step whether the two formulas are equivalent
   - For multiple-choice questions: compare only the final choice and corresponding option content

3. Multi-part Answers:
   - For questions requiring multiple responses (e.g., multi-select):
   - All parts must match the standard answer exactly. 
   - Compare each sub-answer step by step. Partial matches are considered incorrect.

4. Validity Check:
   - Reject answers that are:
     * Incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the final sentence, lacking a complete response) → Label as INCOMPLETE
     * Repetitive (repetition of words or phrases in a loop) → Label as REPETITIVE
     * Explicit refusals (e.g., directly return "I cannot answer/provide/access ...") → Label as REFUSAL
   - For invalid answers, specify the type in the judgment (e.g., \\boxed{{C}} - INCOMPLETE).

Grading Scale:
\\boxed{{A}} - CORRECT: 
   - Answer matches standard exactly (including equivalent expressions)
   - For numerical answers: consider as equivalent if values match when rounded appropriately
   - Semantically equivalent responses

\\boxed{{B}} - INCORRECT:
   - Any deviation from standard answer
   - Partial matches for multi-part questions

\\boxed{{C}} - INCOMPLETE/REPETITIVE/REFUSAL:
   - Fails validity criteria above (must specify: INCOMPLETE/REPETITIVE/REFUSAL)

Execution Steps and Output Formats:

Analysis step by step: [
Thoroughly evaluate the candidate's answer including:
(1) First check if the answer is INCOMPLETE (cut off mid-sentence), REPETITIVE (looping repetition), or a REFUSAL (explicit denial) - if so, immediately classify as \\boxed{{C}} with the corresponding type.
(2) Analyze the question's core requirements and the standard answer's structure, for example:
- Strict requirements: Identify mandatory constraints (e.g., simplification, answer order, multi-part completeness)
- Tolerant allowances: Ignore non-critical deviations (e.g., missing option labels in MCQs, equivalent but unformatted expressions)
- Required answer type, precision level, etc.
(3) Perform a detailed comparison between the candidate's final answer and the standard answer, for example:
- Content equivalence
- Permitted variations in numerical precision
- Allowed expression formats]

STEM_PROMPT_TOOL2 = '''
**Objective:** Act as an impartial judge to determine if a given output correctly answers a question, based on a provided reference answer.

**Instructions:**
Your task is to carefully analyze the `pred` in the context of the `question` and compare it to the `reference`. After your analysis, you must provide a final verdict. Your response should conclude with either `\boxed{[Correct]}` or `\boxed{[Incorrect]}`.

You are equipped with the following tools to aid your decision:
1.  **Python Interpreter**: For verifying mathematical calculations.
2.  **Unit Conversion Tool**: For comparing values with different physical units.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  **For Mathematical Questions**:
    a) An output is deemed [Correct] if it is numerically equivalent to the reference, regardless of notation (e.g., $0.5$ is the same as $\frac{1}{2}$).
    b) Disregard differences in units or other non-numerical context (e.g., if the answer is $16$, an output of `16 km` is [Correct]).

2.  **For Questions with Choices**: If the question presents a set of options (e.g., multiple choice), the output is [Correct] as long as it clearly identifies the correct option, either by its content or its label (e.g., "A", "2.", etc.).

3.  **For Open-Ended Questions**: The output must be semantically equivalent to the reference answer. Minor differences in wording are acceptable as long as the core meaning is the same.

4.  **Regarding Multiple Answers in the Output**:
    a) If the reference also contains multiple valid answers, evaluate according to the question.
    b) If the reference contains only a single answer, you must base your judgment on the *final* answer given in the output. If that final answer is wrong or not clearly stated, the entire output is [Incorrect].

Judgement:'''

STEM_PROMPT_TOOL3 = '''
**Your Role:** You're the judge. Your goal is to decide if a new answer (`Predicted Output`) is a good match for the correct `Reference Answer`, given the original `Question`.

**The Main Rule:** After you've made your call, state your final verdict clearly. It must be either `\boxed{[Correct]}` or `\boxed{[Incorrect]}`.

To help you out, you have a couple of tools on hand:
* A **Python interpreter** for executing python code when you feel needed.
* A **Unit Converter** for any tricky measurements.

**Guidelines for Making a Fair Call:**

* **For Math Problems:** If the numbers match, it's correct. Don't sweat the small stuff like notation ($0.5$ is the same as $\frac{1}{2}$) or units (an answer of `16` is correct even if the output says `16 km`).

* **For Multiple-Choice:** If the output clearly picks the right choice (by its letter, number, or by stating the answer itself), give it a pass.

* **For Written Answers:** It's all about the meaning. If the output says the same thing as the reference answer, even with different words, it's correct.

* **The Tricky Case - Multiple Answers:** Pay attention when the output gives more than one answer. If the reference has just *one* correct answer, only judge the **very last answer** in the output. If that final part is wrong or unclear, the whole thing is incorrect.

'''

STEM_PROMPT_1 = '''
**Role:** You are to act as a verification agent. Your sole function is to determine if a predicted answer is correct.

**Task:**
You will be given a `question`, a `pred` (predicted answer), and a `reference` (the ground truth answer). Compare the `pred` to the `reference` and determine its validity. Your output must be one of two possible responses: `[Correct]` or `[Incorrect]`.

**Verification Rules:**

1.  **Regarding Mathematical Content:**
    * **Equivalence:** The prediction is considered correct if it is mathematically equivalent to the reference, regardless of the format (e.g., $\frac{5}{2}$ is equivalent to $2.5$).
    * **Units & Context:** Ignore peripheral information like units or domains. If the numerical value is correct, the answer is correct (e.g., `100` is a correct match for `100 lbs`).

2.  **Regarding Multiple Choice Questions:**
    * The prediction is correct if it unambiguously selects the correct option, either by quoting its text or referring to its identifier (e.g., 'C', 'iii', etc.).

3.  **Regarding Open-Ended Questions:**
    * The prediction is correct only if its meaning is substantially the same as the reference answer.

4.  **Regarding Predictions with Multiple Answers:**
    * If the reference answer is also multi-part, compare the corresponding parts.
    * If the reference answer is singular, you must evaluate *only the final answer* provided in the prediction. If this final part is incorrect or unclear, the entire prediction is deemed incorrect.

Your core responsibility is to precisely determine if a "Predicted Answer" is correct based on the provided "Reference Answer" (the ground truth).

### **Adjudication Protocol**
You must strictly adhere to the following guidelines when making your judgment:

1.  **Regarding Mathematical Content:**
    * **Equivalence:** The prediction is considered correct if it is mathematically equivalent to the reference, regardless of format (e.g., $2.5$ is equivalent to $\frac{5}{2}$).
    * **Ignore Peripherals:** Non-essential information like units (e.g., `lbs`, `kg`) or contextual phrasing should be disregarded. If the core numerical value is correct, the answer is correct.

2.  **Regarding Multiple-Choice Questions:**
    * The prediction is correct if it unambiguously identifies the correct option, whether by its letter ('C'), number ('iii'), or by quoting its text.

3.  **Regarding Open-Ended Questions:**
    * The core meaning of the prediction must be substantially the same as the reference answer.
